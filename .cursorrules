# Cursor Rules

# --- GENERAL CODE EDITING ---
- When editing or fixing code, output only the raw, functional code.
- Do NOT include:
  - Markdown formatting or code fences (```)
  - Explanations, reasoning, or summaries
  - Status updates or completion messages
  - Documentation, comments, or helper scripts unless explicitly requested
  - Tutorials or example usage

# --- EXCEPTIONS ---
- Only include explanations or extra text if the user explicitly asks for them.

# --- STYLE CONSISTENCY ---
- Keep the code’s original indentation, formatting, and structure unless refactoring is requested.

# --- OUTPUT FORMAT ---
- Output must be **only the code**, with no text, markdown, or commentary of any kind.
